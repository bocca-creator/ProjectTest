The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the task by thoroughly analyzing the application's current state against the provided product requirements. It was quickly identified that the leaderboard functionality was already complete, shifting the focus entirely to simplifying the personal account page. The engineer executed targeted frontend modifications to , fixing syntax errors and removing irrelevant functions (). Testing revealed an authentication issue, leading to a crucial backend validation step that resolved a missing dependency. This ensured the core CS2 statistics system and protected routes are now fully functional. The work is now poised for comprehensive frontend testing to validate the UI changes and data flow post-login.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to enhance a Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) application by refining its player statistics display.
1.  **Leaderboard Page**: A dedicated page designed to showcase all players with their respective rankings, K/D ratios, win rates, and other comprehensive statistics. Players should be ordered with top ranks at the top, descending thereafter. The display should be presented using tables or cards.
    *   *Current Status*: This requirement is fully met; the leaderboard page is already implemented and functioning as specified.
2.  **Personal Account Page**: A simplified personal profile page for individual users. It must display only essential statistics: K/D ratio, win rate, and total matches played. All other detailed statistics that were previously shown on this page are to be removed.
    *   *Current Status*: The  has been modified to reflect these changes, though full frontend validation after successful login is pending.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React.js for frontend, FastAPI for backend, MongoDB as the database.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Used for UI styling.
-   **Supervisor**: Manages service processes (frontend, backend).
-   **Kubernetes Ingress**: Handles API routing, requiring  prefix for backend calls.
-   **Environment Variables**:  and  for dynamic configurations.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

The application adheres to a standard full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns.



**Relevant Files and Changes:**

*   
    *   **Importance**: Provides an initial overview of the application's status and previous testing outcomes, confirming the CS2 statistics system and protected routes are operational.
    *   **Summary of Changes Made**: Read to understand the context and updated by the backend testing agent to reflect successful backend validation.

*   
    *   **Importance**: Houses the core FastAPI application logic, including API endpoints for player statistics, game maps, weapon data, and match history.
    *   **Summary of Changes Made**: No direct modifications were made by the AI engineer in this trajectory. Its functionality was confirmed via , which also resolved a critical missing dependency, making the CS2 statistics system fully operational.

*   
    *   **Importance**: The main React component that handles application-wide concerns, including routing and component rendering.
    *   **Summary of Changes Made**: Read to understand the existing routing and component structure. No modifications were made.

*   
    *   **Importance**: A dedicated React component responsible for displaying player leaderboard information, including rankings, K/D, and win rates.
    *   **Summary of Changes Made**: Read for review. No changes were made as the AI engineer assessed it to be already fully implemented and working as per requirements.

*   
    *   **Importance**: This React component displays an individual player's personal statistics. It was the primary target for modifications to simplify the displayed information.
    *   **Summary of Changes Made**:
        *   Initial attempt to modify the file resulted in a JSX parsing error.
        *   Fixed a syntax error, specifically an extra opening brace, to resolve the parsing issue.
        *   Removed the  function, as displaying player ranks was no longer a requirement for the simplified personal account page. The goal was to reduce the displayed statistics to only K/D, win rate, and matches played.

<current_work>
The current state of the application involves frontend modifications aimed at simplifying the personal account page and backend validation to ensure data integrity. The previous AI engineer confirmed that the Leaderboard Page () is already fully functional and meets all product requirements. The primary focus then shifted to the , where changes were implemented to show only minimal statistics: K/D, win rate, and matches played. This involved removing more detailed statistics and the  function from this component.

During the testing phase, an authentication issue was encountered, preventing successful login attempts and thus access to protected routes like the Account and Leaderboard pages. To resolve this, the backend was thoroughly tested using . This testing successfully identified and fixed a critical missing dependency, ensuring that the backend's CS2 statistics system is now fully operational and all related endpoints are functional. The protected routes are also confirmed to be working correctly, redirecting unauthenticated users as expected.

Therefore, the application's backend is stable and validated. The frontend  has been updated as per requirements, but its full functionality, especially concerning data display post-login, remains to be verified through comprehensive frontend testing.
